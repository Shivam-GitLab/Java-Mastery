# Java Streams Learning Order (Basic → Advanced)

This folder contains examples of Java Streams, arranged in a learning sequence from **basic** to **advanced**.

## 📚 Learning Order

1. **StreamDemo**
    - Basic introduction to Java Streams
    - How to create and use a Stream

2. **IntermediateOps**
    - Common intermediate operations
    - Examples: `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`, `distinct()`

3. **TerminalOps**
    - Common terminal operations
    - Examples: `forEach()`, `collect()`, `reduce()`, `count()`

4. **LazyEvaluationDemo**
    - Demonstrates the lazy nature of streams
    - Streams execute operations only when a terminal operation is invoked

5. **CollectorsDemo**
    - Usage of `Collectors` utility class
    - Examples: `toList()`, `toSet()`, `groupingBy()`, `partitioningBy()`

6. **PrimitiveStreams**
    - Specialized streams for primitives
    - Examples: `IntStream`, `LongStream`, `DoubleStream`

7. **ParallelStream**
    - Working with streams in parallel
    - Improves performance for large datasets with multi-core processors
